wake
====

Tiny program for sending out wake-on-lan packets

Usage:
> ./wake <broadcast-address> <mac-address> [mac-address ...]

broadcast-address: the network's broadcast address
mac-address: the MAC address of the ethernet adapter of the computer you want to wake

For this to work, the wake-on-lan setting has to be enabled in the bios.
